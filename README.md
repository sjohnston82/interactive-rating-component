## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This was one of the easier looking challenges I've come across on FEM, so I decided to just use HTML, vanilla JS and CSS because sometimes I feel like I am too reliant on abstractions like React and NextJs. I also wanted to use URL params to pass the rating state from the main to the thank you page, because in the past in a situation like that I only have used local storage.
